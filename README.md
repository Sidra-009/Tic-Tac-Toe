# 🎮 Tic Tca Tao 
### **“An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI powered by Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.”**

TicTac AI is an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **Python** and **Pygame**, designed for demonstrating AI concepts such as **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.  
The AI evaluates game states, predicts outcomes, blocks human wins, and always chooses the optimal move — making it impossible to defeat.
